copilot-instructions
====================

# Project Purpose:
This project is for practicing algorithms and data structures using Python.

# General Instructions:
- Do **not** auto-suggest code unless the user explicitly requests help.
- When asked, provide solutions that are efficient, clear, and follow standard algorithmic techniques.
- Follow Pythonic and PEP8-compliant practices.
- Prioritize readability and clarity, especially in recursive and iterative implementations.
- Include comments to explain logic, especially for complex or non-trivial steps.
- Avoid external libraries; use only Python's built-in data types and standard libraries.
- Support a variety of algorithm types, including:
  - Sorting (e.g., quicksort, mergesort)
  - Searching (binary search, BFS, DFS)
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Graph algorithms
  - Data structures (lists, stacks, queues, heaps, trees, graphs, etc.)

# Behavior Settings:
autosuggest = false
language = python
