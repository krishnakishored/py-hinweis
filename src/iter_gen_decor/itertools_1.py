'''
the functions in itertools “operate” on iterators to produce more complex iterators
    - zip_longest()
    - combinations()
    - permutations()
    - count()
    
    - combinations_with_replacement()

def naive_grouper(inputs, n):
    num_groups = len(inputs) // n
    return [tuple(inputs[i*n:(i+1)*n]) for i in range(num_groups)]

def better_grouper(inputs, n):
    '''
    The expression [iters(inputs)] * n creates a list of n references to the same iterator
    '''
    iters = [iter(inputs)] * n
    '''
    Next, zip(*iters) returns an iterator over pairs of corresponding elements of each iterator in iters.
    When the first element, 1, is taken from the “first” iterator, the “second” iterator now starts at 2 since it is just a reference to the “first” iterator and has therefore been advanced one step.
    So, the first tuple produced by zip() is (1, 2).
    At this point, “both” iterators in iters start at 3, so when zip() pulls 3 from the “first” iterator, 
    it gets 4 from the “second” to produce the tuple (3, 4). 
    This process continues until zip() finally produces (9, 10) and “both” iterators in iters are exhausted:
