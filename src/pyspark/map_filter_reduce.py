# The map call is similar to the list comprehension expression.
# But map applies a function call to each item instead of an arbitrary expression. 
# Because of this limitation, it is somewhat less general tool. 
# In some cases, however, map may be faster to run than a list comprehension such as when mapping a built-in function

# Because map expects a function to be passed in, 
# ÃŸit also happens to be one of the places where lambda routinely appears:
doubled = list(map((lambda x:x*2),items))
