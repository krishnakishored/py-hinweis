1: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
2: And sorry I could not travel both
3: And be one traveler, long I stood
4: And looked down one as far as I could
5: To where it bent in the undergrowth;

7: Then took the other, as just as fair,
8: And having perhaps the better claim,
9: Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
10: Though as for that the passing there
11: Had worn them really about the same,
12: 
13: And both that morning equally lay
14: In leaves no step had trodden black.
15: Oh, I kept the first for another day!
16: Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
17: I doubted if I should ever come back.
18: 
19: I shall be telling this with a sigh
20: Somewhere ages and ages hence:
21: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
22: I took the one less traveled by,
23: And that has made all the difference.1: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
